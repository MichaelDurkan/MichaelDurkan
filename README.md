### 👋 Welcome!! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Michael Durkan. I live in the midlands of Ireland. I'm 44 years young, married and have two children who keep me busy and entertained!

A bit about me - I've been in the IT Infrastructure space for over 20 years, and have worked my way up the ladder from Call Centre Agent, HelpDesk, Workstation Support, System Administrator. I have a passion for learning, and always find myself back in front of my laptop immersed in the latest tech and trying to make it work. I'm a fledgling blogger trying to bring the things I learn to a wider audience - you'll find my posts on my blog at michaeldurkan.com.

I'm a Microsoft Azure MVP, and hold multiple Azure certifications. I'm also MCSE 2016 and Juniper Networks certified.

I work as a Cloud Solutions Architect for Avanade, working on helping customers achieve their business goals using the power of Microsoft technologies.

- 🌱 What I'm learning ...

I'm currently ramping up on my DevOps (particularly Terraform) and Security skills in the Azure space.
