### 👋 Welcome!! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Michael Durkan. I live in the midlands of Ireland. I'm 43 years young, married and have two children who keep me busy and entertained!

A bit about me - I've been in the IT Infrastructure space for over 20 years, and have worked my way up the ladder from Call Centre Agent, HelpDesk, Workstation Support, System Administrator. I have a passion for learning, and always find myself back in front of my laptop immersed in the latest tech and trying to make it work. I'm a fledgling blogger trying to bring the things I learn to a wider audience - you'll find most of my posts on Medium.

I'm Azure, MCSE and Juniper Networks certified.

- 🔭 Where I work ...

I work as an Senior Engineer for Ekco, an Irish-owned Managed Services Provider. I work mainly on Microsoft technologies, but am integrating some Automation, Linux and OpenSource components into my day-to-day role.

- 🌱 What I'm learning ...

I'm studying using Cloudskills.io and have just completed their CloudNative DevOps Bootcamp. I'm interested in ramping up on my DevOps skills (particularly Python and Terraform) and also have an interest in learning more about AWS.
